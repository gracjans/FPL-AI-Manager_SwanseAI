*Note: **This repository is still in development**. It can already be used for FPL decision-making process, 
but needs some refactoring and adaptation for more convenient use. 
Tests are also a must. Full automation is planned, as currently it is the user who has to click out changes.*

*A detailed report about data preparation and model training will also be prepared 
alongside with documentation and 'how to use' instructions.*
